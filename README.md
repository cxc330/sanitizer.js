#Santizer.js

Sanitizer.js is a JavaScript Library designed to help sanitize your string inputs. Currently being developed for a Computer Security class. The idea is this JavaScript Library will be useful to do some client-side sanitization (not 100% secure because it IS on client side), and will definitely be useful for Node.js development.

This project is open-source and open to be modified.
